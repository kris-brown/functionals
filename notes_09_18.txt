Outline for Jens Sept 2018
--------------------------
Need: main project + 2-3 subprojects (give current status report)
  Main Project
    Development of a BEEF style functional - optimized for catalysis
    Metrics for success:
      - improvement of chemisorption energies (chemical accuracy)
      - improved transferability (look at residuals compared to mBEEF)
    Path to success
      - Analytical constraints + BEEF coefficient fitting (modifications to basis functions - SCAN inspiration)
      - train with multiple pseudopotentials to avoid PP bias
      - Lattice optimization, Surface relaxation, Bulk modulus, Reaction energies, Chemisorption energies
    Incremental Progress
      - Understand at higher level - incremental progress towards better functionals
      - Focusing on chemi/physi-sorption while using constraints to avoid unphysical (e.g. worse lattice constants of BEEF vs PBEsol)
      - Improve chemisorption accuracy without chemisorption data: mBEEF style + SCAN constraints
      - Exploring regions of s/alpha space are relevant (possibility for tailoring functionals to domains or making 'data-free' regions analytical (due to soft PP, we don't get diverse data))

Related-Subprojects
  - Parameterized BEEF coefficients from system analysis (ML)
  - Personalized functional fitting
    - Easy to use python package as a deliverable
    - AKA optimized over materials and output domains
  - Density error reduction for surfaces (surface magnetic moments? atoms?)
  - Google subproject???
