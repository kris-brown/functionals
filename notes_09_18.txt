Outline for Jens Sept 2018
--------------------------
Need: main project + 2-3 subprojects (give current status report)
  Main Project
    Development of a BEEF style functional - optimized for catalysis
    Metrics for success:
      - improvement of chemisorption energies (chemical accuracy)
      - improved transferability (look at residuals compared to mBEEF)
    Path to success
      - Analytical constraints + BEEF coefficient fitting
      - sg15 pseudopotentials for well-behaved transition metals
      - Lattice optimization, Surface relaxation, Bulk modulus, Reaction energies, Chemisorption energies
    Incremental Progress
      - Understand at higher level - incremental progress towards better functionals
      - Improve chemisorption accuracy without chemisorption data: mBEEF style + SCAN constraints
Related-Subprojects
  - Parameterized BEEF coefficients from system analysis (ML)
  - Personalized functionals, optimized over materials and output domains
  - Density error reduction for surfaces
